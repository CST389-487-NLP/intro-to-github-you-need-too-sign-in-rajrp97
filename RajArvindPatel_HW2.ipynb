I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.', 'label': 0}\n"

        "The next cell must define the IMDBMLP (IMDB Multi-Layer Perceptron) model, which is a neural network designed for sentiment classification. Below I summarize the required structure and requirements.\n",
        " - `class IMDBMLP(nn.Module)` - class definition of the IMDBMLP class inherits from nn.Module, the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch.\n",
        "- `__init__ method` is the constructor where all the layers of the network are defined:\n",
        "- `self.embedding = nn.EmbeddingBag(vocab_size, embedding_dim, sparse=False)` creates an embedding layer. `EmbeddingBag` is particularly efficient for text classification where you might have variable-length sequences. It takes the `vocab_size` (total number of unique words), `embedding_dim` (the size of the vector representation for each word), and `sparse=False` ensures dense gradients, which is generally better for optimizers like Adam.\n",
        "- `self.fc1 = ...` defines the first fully connected (linear) layer. It takes the output from the embedding layer (which is an `embedding_dim`-sized vector representing the entire text) and transforms it into hidden_dim1 features.\n",
        "- `self.gelu1 =...` is the hidden GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) activation layer, which introduces non-linearity after the first linear layer.\n",
        "- `self.fc2 =...` is the second fully connected layer, further transforming features.\n",
        "- `self.gelu2 = nn.GELU()` another GELU activation layer.\n",
        "-`self.fc3 = ...` is the final linear layer, that creates logits, i.e.  outputs `num_class` values (2 in this case, for positive/negative sentiment).\n",
        "-`self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)` layer applies the Softmax function to the output of fc3 to convert the raw scores into probabilities for each class, ensuring they sum to 1.\n",
        "After defitinions of layers come methods:\n",
        "- `forward` method defines how data flows through the network during a forward pass:\n",
        "`embedded = self.embedding(text, offsets)`. The input text (token IDs) and offsets (indicating start positions of each text in a batch) are passed to the EmbeddingBag layer to get the text embeddings.\n",
        "- The embedded output then sequentially passes through fc1, gelu1, fc2, gelu2, and fc3. Finally, self.softmax(x) converts the raw logits into probability distribution over the classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "You must define the following model hyperparameters:\n",
        "-`VOCAB_SIZE` Determined by the `len(vocab)` from previous cells.\n",
        "-`EMBEDDING_DIM` is the dimensionality of the word embeddings (you can choose any value from 50 to 2024 but in your comments you must justify your choice).\n",
        "- `HIDDEN_DIM1, HIDDEN_DIM2` are the sizes (number of neurons) of the hidden layers in the MLP (again it is your choice but you should explain it).\n",
        "- `NUM_CLASSES` is 2 for binary sentiment classification.\n",
        "Next we instantiate the model `model_imdb_mlp = IMDBMLP(...)` - it creates an actual instance of your neural network. And then print model summary using `torchinfo.summary()` that provides a detailed overview of the model, including its layers, output shapes, number of parameters for each layer, and total parameters. The input_size and dtypes arguments are crucial here to simulate the input shape that the model expects for text (a 1D tensor of token IDs) and offsets (a 1D tensor of start indices) for a sample batch.\n",
